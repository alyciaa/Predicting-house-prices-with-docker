# Predicting-house-prices-with-docker

The objective of my application is to predict the price of a house according to certain characteristics
that the user would have entered beforehand. <br />
So the algorithm is able to predict these prices based on the following attributes entered at
GUI level: <br />

• bedrooms: represents the number of bedrooms. <br />
• bathrooms: number of bathrooms. <br />
• sqft_living: area of the house. <br />
• sqft_lot: area of the land. <br />
• floors: number of floors. <br />
• waterfront: house by the sea or not. <br /> 
• view: If it is a beautiful view (view of the sea or mountains, etc.).<br />
• zipcode: the postal code to judge the location. <br />
