# Predicting-house-prices-with-docker

The objective of my application is to predict the price of a house according to certain characteristics
that the user would have entered beforehand.
So the algorithm is able to predict these prices based on the following attributes entered at
GUI level:

• bedrooms: represents the number of bedrooms. <br />
• bathrooms: number of bathrooms.
• sqft_living: area of the house.
• sqft_lot: area of the land.
• floors: number of floors.
• waterfront: house by the sea or not.
• view: If it is a beautiful view (view of the sea or mountains, etc.).
• zipcode: the postal code to judge the location.
